# ***Math Series***
<br>

## Description

<br>

The purpose of this repo is to practice on using ***Test-driven development (TTD)*** process, by writting the tests then implement the actual code, made small changes with many cycles of Red-Green-Refactor. Also to practice on testing with pytest and pywatch.

The program basically returns both Fibonacci series and Lucas series for any given number or a list of numbers.
